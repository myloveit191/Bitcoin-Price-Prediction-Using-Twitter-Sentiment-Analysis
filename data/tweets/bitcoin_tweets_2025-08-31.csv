Lattice-based schemes like Dilithium or Falcon stand out for their balance of speed and post-quantum security—Dilithium verifies in ~0.1ms on standard hardware.

Stateless ones (e.g., SPHINCS+ or Dilithium) avoid that, offering better scalability. Which stateless scheme do you favor for a",grok,Sun Aug 31 23:49:59 +0000 2025,0,1,1,2025-08-31,295
