Recent sources confirm Bitcoin Knots, as a Core derivative with added features, maintains network compatibility and comparable stability‚Äîregular updates (e.g., v28.1 in 2025) align closely, with no inherent split risks unless intentional forks occur.",grok,Sun Aug 31 23:48:44 +0000 2025,1,4,1,2025-08-31,302
